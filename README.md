## Annotations

### Running Rust, File structure and naming

Rust files always end with the *.rs* extension. If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use *hello_world.rs* rather than helloworld.rs.

To compile a .rs file into executable execute `rustc filename`: `rustc main.rs`

**using Cargo** 

We can create a project using cargo new.  
We can build a project using cargo build.  
We can build and run a project in one step using cargo run.  
We can build a project without producing a binary to check for errors using cargo check.  
Instead of saving the result of the build in the same directory as our code, Cargo stores it in the target/debug directory.  
When your project is finally ready for release, you can use cargo build --release to compile it with optimizations.
