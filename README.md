## Annotations

File structure and naming

Rust files always end with the *.rs* extension. If youâ€™re using more than one word in your filename, the convention is to use an underscore to separate them. For example, use *hello_world.rs* rather than helloworld.rs.

To compile a .rs file into executable execute `rustc filename`: `rustc main.rs`
